# Semantic Interest Miner Backend

This is the backend of the Semantic Interest Miner web application.

## Before running the application:

Please download word embedding model[(GloVe)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FfQgEjR6q1NyFsD_-kOdBCHMXB2QmNxN/view?usp=sharing) .

Please put the model file in the root directory of this folder.
